		<p>This title captures the storylines from the ongoing Spider-Man newspaper written by Stan Lee and offered by King Features. The strip started in 1977, and is syndicated in many newspapers. The stories are not set in the "comic book" continuity, but are in their own slowly-changing world which avoids most of the extreme character shifts which tend to happen in the mainstream continuity.</p>
		<p>It was on the pages of Amazing Fantasy No. 15 where the Amazing Spider-Man first appeared. And in March 1963, one year after his first appearance, Spider-Man was starring in his own comic book and on his way to becoming Marvel Comics' most popular super hero ever!</p>
		<p>Through the years, Spider-Man has also been a superpower in the world of licensing, appearing in paperback books, on posters, as an action figure, and in video games. And in addition to his licensing ventures, Spider-Man is also capturing bad guys in a hit animated TV show.</p>
		<p>In 1977, Spider-Man began starring in his own newspaper comic strip written by his creator, Stan Lee. The Amazing Spider-Man can be seen in newspapers worldwide and was a part of the first-ever comic strip/comic book crossover story.</p>
		<p>In the summer of 2002, Spider-Man swung onto the silver screen and broke box office records with its massive first weekend receipts. Based upon the freak accident that miraculously granted Peter Parker with his incredible spider-like abilities, the movie starring Tobey Maguire became a smash hit with audiences worldwide. The sequel was released in the summer of 2004.</p>
		<p>Known to millions as the man whose Super Heroes propelled Marvel Comics to its preeminent position in the comic book industry, Stan Lee's famous co-creations include Spider-Man, The Incredible Hulk, X-Men, The Fantastic Four, Iron Man, Daredevil, The Avengers, Silver Surfer and Dr. Strange, among many others. Lee first became publisher of Marvel Comics in 1972 and is presently the Chairman Emeritus of Marvel Enterprises, Inc. and a member of the Editorial Board of Marvel Comics. In 1977, he introduced Spider-Man as a syndicated newspaper strip that went on to become one of the most successful of all syndicated adventure strips. Spider-Man now appears in more than 500 newspapers worldwide making it the longest running of all Super Hero strips.</p>
