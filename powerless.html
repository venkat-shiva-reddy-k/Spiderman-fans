	<p>Powerless is a six-issue comic book limited series published by Marvel Comics which ran from 2004 to 2005. The series was written by Matt Cherniss & Peter Johnson and penciled by artist Michael Gaydos.</p>
	<p>The series begins with a psychologist, Dr. William Watts, waking suddenly in a hospital bed. According to his doctor, Dr. Susan Storm, he has been in a coma for three days after falling on the sidewalk in front of his apartment. Dr. Watts remarks that he had incredibly vivid dreams of fantastical heroes and villains during his coma, so much so that he has trouble distinguishing which world is reality.</p>
	<p>Peter Parker looses his powers, but are they gone for good?</p>
	<p>After an experiment to map Peter's blood goes wrong, he temporarily loses his powers, but Peter later realises this could be a blessing and goes back to have his powers removed permanently, letting him lead a normal life. This leads to some very interesting issues, with a powerless Spidey being forced to go up against The Tarantula and The Scorpion (with a little help from the Black Cat), forcing him once again to get his powers back and don the mask of the Amazing Spiderman.</p>
