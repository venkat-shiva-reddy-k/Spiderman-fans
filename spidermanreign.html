		<p>Spider-Man: Reign depicts an older Spider-Man in the future who, having given up on crime-fighting, is driven back into action by the return of some of his old enemies, exposing a conspiracy by Venom to take control of the city with a mass of symbiotes.The character is later killed by Daemos with his head smashed by Mary Jane Watson's tombstone in "Spider-Verse".</p>
		<p>Spider-Man: Reign is a four-issue comic book limited series featuring Spider-Man, written and illustrated by Kaare Andrews and published by Marvel Comics. Set 30 years into Spider-Man's future, in Earth-70237, it features a retired Spider-Man who returns to combat the injustices of a vastly different New York City.</p>
		<p>On December 12, 2006, Marvel announced that issue #1 had sold out through Diamond Comic Distributors and that a second printing would be released</p>
		<p>The series has been compared to Batman: The Dark Knight Returns, a comparison which Marvel has also quoted when promoting Reign.[1] As well as the thematic similarities between the two stories, both of which revisit aged heroes after the end of their careers, The Dark Knight Returns is also acknowledged within the pages of Reign by the inclusion of a character named Miller Janson (the name reflects Dark Knight Returns creators Frank Miller and Klaus Janson)</p>
		<p>The book also has several themes relevant in the post 9/11 world, most notably Mayor Waters taking control of the city of New York to protect it, and the WEBB, an energy field that seals all of New York inside it so no one can leave.</p>
		<p>The series has been collected into a single volume:

Hardcover (collects #1–4, April 2007, 160 pages, ISBN 0-7851-1717-2)
Paperback (collects #1–4, April 2008, 160 pages, ISBN 0-7851-2665-1)
Also, within the first print run of Spider-Man: Reign, there is a panel known as the "Nude Panel". As the elderly Peter Parker sits on the edge of his bed (hands on his face), it was noticed that his genitals were drawn in. This error exists on both Black & Red Suit variant covers of Spider-Man: Reign #1. The issue was soon recalled and removed from the second run of Spider-Man: Reign #1 for fear of "corrupting minors".</p>
