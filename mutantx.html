		       <p>"The Six Arms Saga" is a story arc from the popular Marvel Comic Spider-Man, written by Stan Lee and drawn by Gil Kane. It spans the issues Amazing Spider-Man #100–102 (1971) and features the first appearance of Morbius, the Living Vampire.</p>
			   <p>The story arc is mostly remembered for Spider-Man's striking aesthetics, swinging through the city with four extra arms.</p>
			   <p>Peter Parker has had enough of being Spider-Man. Peter feels miserable about all the anguish he has had to endure. When his best friend Harry Osborn has become a junkie, his close friend Captain George Stacy died in his arms, and Gwen Stacy – Spidey's girlfriend – wrongly blamed Spider-Man for her father's death, Peter has a fatal thought: for Peter Parker to live, Spider-Man must die!</p>
			   <p>So, Spidey brews up a chemical cocktail intended to terminate his spider powers. Peter takes the cocktail and falls into a troubled sleep in which he fights all his enemies, while enduring excruciating side pains. When he wakes up, he notices a ghastly thing: he has six arms. The potion increased his spider powers rather than nullifying them.</p>
			   <p>He then visits his only possible confidant Dr. Curt Connors and fights a vampiric villain called Morbius, the Living Vampire. Although the stress of confronting Morbius makes Connors transform into the Lizard; using an enzyme Morbius "infected" the Lizard with when he bit him allows Connors to retain his mind even as the Lizard.</p>
			   <p>Eventually, Spider-Man and Connors brew an antidote that turns them both back to normal.</p>
			   <p>In the Mutant X universe, Spider-Man still has six arms. For unexplained reasons, he has taken to calling himself Man-Spider instead of Spider-Man. Moreover, the chemical he consumed apparently altered his DNA, since his clone (who is killed by Madelyne Pryor within the series[1]) also has six arms.</p>
			   <p>In the run-up to Spider-Verse, after learning that something is crossing dimensions to kill Spider-Men, the 'Superior Spider-Man'- Doctor Octopus in Peter Parker's body- assembles a team of the more ruthless surviving Spider-Men to oppose this threat, including a six-armed Spider-Man wearing a costume perfectly adapted to his condition.[2] During the storyline, this Spider-Man accompanies Spider-Man Noir to a world where the spider-bite left Peter in a coma, with the six-armed Spider-Man using the serum that gave him his extra arms to cure Peter of his mutation for good, guessing that Peter's mutation being so new would make it more receptive to the serum.[3] However, the six-armed Spider-Man is later killed during a trip to 2099 with Lady Spider and Spider-Man 2099 when he is caught and fed on by one of the Inheritors</p>
