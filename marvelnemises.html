		       <p>Marvel Nemesis: Rise of the Imperfects is a fighting game for the PlayStation 2, Xbox, GameCube, Nintendo DS, and PSP, which ties into the "Marvel Nemesis" comic book series.</p>
			   <p>The game pitches a series of Marvel heroes and villains, including Venom, Wolverine, Iron Man, and Spider-Man against a series of original EA-created/owned characters. Combat is simplified in favor of allowing the player greater movement, and the game initially drew comparisons to Power Stone, Super Smash Bros. and Ehrgeiz as a result. The video game is based on the Marvel comic book series with the same name, a 6-issue miniseries published from June to December 2005. The miniseries does not depict the events in the game or vice versa, and has a completely different story than the video game. There are even points in the video game story and the comic books that directly contradict each other. The comic does, however, star the same characters as the video game and introduces the EA characters with, aside from one or two minor details, the same background stories and powers. The EA characters are said to be part of the regular Marvel continuity but due to the games' poor response and the fact that they're owned by Electronic Arts, they have only appeared in the above-mentioned miniseries and may never be heard of in the Marvel Universe again.</p>
			   <p>The game featured Fatality-like finishing moves that could be triggered as soon as an opponent's health falls to 25% or lower. Many complaints about the game revolved around the fact that AI opponents would chain-abuse projectile special moves, dealing significant damage to a player character, with the AI character immediately triggering the fatality upon dropping the player to low health.</p>
			   <p>Rise of the Imperfects was the only game from a Marvel-Electronic Arts partnership formed in 2004. The partnership terminated in early 2008. There was a six-issue comic book limited series published by Marvel Comics. The series was written by Greg Pak and drawn by Renato Arlem. It was a tie-in and prequel to the game published from July 2005 to December 2006.</p>
			   <p>Marvel Nemesis was met with mixed to negative reception, often criticized for its poor story mode and limited multiplayer. Aggregating review site Metacritic gave it a score of 53, based on 30 reviews.</p>
