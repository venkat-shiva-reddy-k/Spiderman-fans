			   <div id="head"> <h3>Summary</h3></div>
<p>Peter Parker is an unhappy man: after two years of fighting crime as Spider-Man, his life has begun to fall apart. The girl he loves is engaged to someone else, his grades are slipping, he cannot keep any of his jobs, and on top of it, the newspaper Daily Bugle is attacking him viciously, claiming that Spider-Man is a criminal. He reaches the breaking point and gives up the crime fighter's life, once and for all. But after a failed fusion experiment, eccentric and obsessive scientist Dr. Otto Octavius is transformed into super villain Doctor Octopus, Doc Ock for short, having four long tentacles as extra hands. Peter guesses it might just be time for Spider-Man to return, but would he act upon it?</p>

<div id="head"> <h3>Sequels</h3></div>
<p>Despite the many super-hero movies which have followed after it, Spider-Man 2 still regularly tops rankings as one of the best-loved of the genre. In 2012, Ask Men wrote, "This is the high-water mark for Spider-Man movies, and good luck to anyone who wants to top it."

In 2013, Screen Crush wrote,"Sam Raimi's second outing with the web-slinging hero is as perfect as superhero movies get, nailing everything that's great about its hero without sacrificing the unique tone established by the first film. How exactly does Raimi pull off a movie that's simultaneously goofy, melancholy, romantic, frightening, melodramatic, crazily intense and emotionally fulfilling? Some kind of cinematic alchemy, apparently."Forbes described it as "Not just one of the greatest sequels, but one of the best films of the genre, period."

In 2014, Yahoo Movies! wrote, "Raimi's best superhero movie still takes the cake."

Spider-Man 2 is Rotten Tomatoes's second best-reviewed comic book film of all time, beating out X2: X-Men United, Batman Begins and Superman.It remains the second highest-rated superhero film behind The Dark Knight at 93% on rottentomatoes.com. In 2007, Entertainment Weekly named it the No. 21 greatest action film of all time.</p>
