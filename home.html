                </div>
		         <p>Spider-Man is a fictional superhero appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics existing in
				 its shared universe. The character was created by writer-editor Stan Lee and writer-artist Steve Ditko, and first
				 appeared in the anthology comic book Amazing Fantasy #15 (Aug. 1962) in the Silver Age of Comic Books. Lee and Ditko 
				 conceived the character as an orphan being raised by his Aunt May and Uncle Ben, and as a teenager, having to deal 
				 with the normal struggles of adolescence in addition to those of a costumed crime-fighter. Spider-Man's creators gave 
				 him super strength and agility, the ability to cling to most surfaces, shoot spider-webs using wrist-mounted devices 
				 of his own invention, which he calls "web-shooters", and react to danger quickly with his "spider-sense", enabling him 
				 to combat his foes.</p>
				 
                <p>When Spider-Man first appeared in the early 1960s, teenagers in superhero comic books were usually relegated to the 
				role of sidekick to the protagonist. The Spider-Man series broke ground by featuring Peter Parker, the high school 
				student behind Spider-Man's secret identity and with whose "self-obsessions with rejection, inadequacy, and loneliness" 
				young readers could relate.While Spider-Man had all the makings of a sidekick, unlike previous teen heroes such as 
				Bucky and Robin, Spider-Man had no superhero mentor like Captain America and Batman; he thus had to learn for himself that 
				"with great power there must also come great responsibility"—a line included in a text box in the final panel of the first 
				Spider-Man story but later retroactively attributed to his guardian, the late Uncle Ben.</p>
				
                <p>Marvel has featured Spider-Man in several comic book series, the first and longest-lasting of which is titled 
				The Amazing Spider-Man. Over the years, the Peter Parker character has developed from shy, nerdy high school student
				 to troubled but outgoing college student, to married high school teacher to, in the late 2000s, a single freelance 
				 photographer. In the 2010s, he joins the Avengers, Marvel's flagship superhero team. Spider-Man's nemesis Doctor 
				 Octopus also took on the identity for a story arc spanning 2012–2014, following a body swap plot in which Peter 
				 appears to die.Separately, Marvel has also published books featuring alternate versions of Spider-Man, including 
				 Spider-Man 2099, which features the adventures of Miguel O'Hara, the Spider-Man of the future; Ultimate Spider-Man, 
				 which features the adventures of a teenaged Peter Parker in an alternate universe; and Ultimate Comics Spider-Man, 
				 which depicts the teenager Miles Morales, who takes up the mantle of Spider-Man after Ultimate Peter Parker's 
				 supposed death.</p>
				 
				 <p>Spider-Man is one of the most popular and commercially successful superheroes.As Marvel's flagship 
				 character and company mascot, he has appeared in countless forms of media, including several animated and 
				 live-action television series, syndicated newspaper comic strips, and in a series of films. In films, Spider-Man 
				 has been portrayed by actors Tobey Maguire (2002–2007) and Andrew Garfield (2012–2014),while Tom Holland will 
				 portray him in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, beginning with Captain America: Civil War in 2016. Reeve Carney starred 
				 as Spider-Man in the 2010 Broadway musical Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark.Spider-Man has been well received as a 
				 superhero and comic book character and is usually ranked as one of the greatest comic book characters of all time 
				 alongside DC Comics characters such as Superman and Batman.</p>
				 
				<div id="head"> <h1>Publication history</h1>
                 <h2>Creation and development</h2>
				 </div>
            <p>In 1962, with the success of the Fantastic Four, Marvel Comics editor and head writer Stan Lee was casting 
			about for a new superhero idea. He said the idea for Spider-Man arose from a surge in teenage demand for comic books, 
			and the desire to create a character with whom teens could identify.In his autobiography, Lee cites the 
			non-superhuman pulp magazine crime fighter the Spider (see also The Spider's Web and The Spider Returns) as a great 
			influence, and in a multitude of print and video interviews, Lee stated he was further inspired by seeing a 
			spider climb up a wall—adding in his autobiography that he has told that story so often he has become unsure of whether 
			or not this is true.Though at the time teenage superheroes were usually given names ending with "boy", Lee says 
			he chose "Spider-Man" because he wanted the character to age as the series progressed, and moreover felt the name 
			"Spider-Boy" would have made the character sound inferior to other superheroes.At that time Lee had to get only the 
			consent of Marvel publisher Martin Goodman for the character's approval. In a 1986 interview, Lee described in detail his 
			arguments to overcome Goodman's objections.Goodman eventually agreed to a Spider-Man tryout in what Lee in 
			numerous interviews recalled as what would be the final issue of the science-fiction and supernatural anthology series 
			Amazing Adult Fantasy, which was renamed Amazing Fantasy for that single issue, #15 (cover-dated August 1962, on sale 
			June 5, 1962).In particular, Lee stated that the fact that it had already been decided that Amazing Fantasy would 
			be cancelled after issue #15 was the only reason Goodman allowed him to use Spider-Man.While this was indeed the 
			final issue, its editorial page anticipated the comic continuing and that "The Spiderman [sic] ... will appear every 
			month in Amazing."</p>
			<div id="middle">
			<img src="images/wentworth.png" style="width:195px;height:200px;" /> 
           <p>Richard Wentworth a.k.a. the Spider in the pulp magazine The Spider. 
		    Stan Lee stated that it was the name of this character that inspired him to create a character 
		    that would become Spider-Man.</p></div>
			
			<p>Regardless, Lee received Goodman's approval for the name Spider-Man and the "ordinary teen" concept, and approached 
			artist Jack Kirby. As comics historian Greg Theakston recounts, Kirby told Lee about an unpublished character on which 
			he had collaborated with Joe Simon in the 1950s, in which an orphaned boy living with an old couple finds a magic ring 
			that granted him superhuman powers. Lee and Kirby "immediately sat down for a story conference", Theakston writes, and 
			Lee afterward directed Kirby to flesh out the character and draw some pages.Steve Ditko would be the inker.
			When Kirby showed Lee the first six pages, Lee recalled, "I hated the way he was doing it! Not that he did it badly—it 
			just wasn't the character I wanted; it was too heroic".Lee turned to Ditko, who developed a visual style Lee found 
			satisfactory. Ditko recalled:</p>
			
			<p id="mid">One of the first things I did was to work up a costume. A vital, visual part of the character. I had to 
			know how he looked ... before I did any breakdowns. For example: A clinging power so he wouldn't have hard shoes or 
			boots, a hidden wrist-shooter versus a web gun and holster, etc. ... I wasn't sure Stan would like the idea of covering 
			the character's face but I did it because it hid an obviously boyish face. It would also add mystery to the 
			character.</p>
			
			<p>Although the interior artwork was by Ditko alone, Lee rejected Ditko's cover art and commissioned Kirby to pencil 
			a cover that Ditko inked.As Lee explained in 2010, "I think I had Jack sketch out a cover for it because I always 
			had a lot of confidence in Jack's covers."</p>
			
			<p>n an early recollection of the character's creation, Ditko described his and Lee's contributions in a mail interview 
			with Gary Martin published in Comic Fan #2 (Summer 1965): "Stan Lee thought the name up. I did costume, web gimmick on 
			wrist & spider signal."At the time, Ditko shared a Manhattan studio with noted fetish artist Eric Stanton, an art-school 
			classmate who, in a 1988 interview with Theakston, recalled that although his contribution to Spider-Man was "almost nil", 
			he and Ditko had "worked on storyboards together and I added a few ideas. But the whole thing was created by Steve on his 
			own... I think I added the business about the webs coming out of his hands."</p>
			
			<p>irby disputed Lee's version of the story, and claimed Lee had minimal involvement in the character's creation. 
			According to Kirby, the idea for Spider-Man had originated with Kirby and Joe Simon, who in the 1950s had developed 
			a character called the Silver Spider for the Crestwood Publications comic Black Magic, who was subsequently not used.
			Simon, in his 1990 autobiography, disputed Kirby's account, asserting that Black Magic was not a factor, and that he 
			(Simon) devised the name "Spider-Man" (later changed to "The Silver Spider"), while Kirby outlined the character's 
			story and powers. Simon later elaborated that his and Kirby's character conception became the basis for Simon's Archie 
			Comics superhero the Fly.Artist Steve Ditko stated that Lee liked the name Hawkman from DC Comics, and that 
			"Spider-Man" was an outgrowth of that interest.</p>
			
			<p>Simon concurred that Kirby had shown the original Spider-Man version to Lee, who liked the idea and assigned 
			Kirby to draw sample pages of the new character but disliked the results—in Simon's description, 
			"Captain America with cobwebs".Writer Mark Evanier notes that Lee's reasoning that Kirby's character 
			was too heroic seems unlikely—Kirby still drew the covers for Amazing Fantasy #15 and the first issue of 
			The Amazing Spider-Man. Evanier also disputes Kirby's given reason that he was "too busy" to also draw Spider-Man 
			in addition to his other duties since Kirby was, said Evanier, "always busy".Neither Lee's nor Kirby's 
			explanation explains why key story elements like the magic ring were dropped; Evanier states that the most plausible 
			explanation for the sudden change was that Goodman, or one of his assistants, decided that Spider-Man as drawn and 
			envisioned by Kirby was too similar to the Fly.</p>
			
			<p>Author and Ditko scholar Blake Bell writes that it was Ditko who noted the similarities to the Fly. 
			Ditko recalled that, "Stan called Jack about the Fly," adding that "[d]ays later, Stan told me I would be penciling 
			the story panel breakdowns from Stan's synopsis". It was at this point that the nature of the strip changed. "Out 
			went the magic ring, adult Spider-Man and whatever legend ideas that Spider-Man story would have contained". Lee gave 
			Ditko the premise of a teenager bitten by a spider and developing powers, a premise Ditko would expand upon to the point 
			he became what Bell describes as "the first work for hire artist of his generation to create and control the narrative 
			arc of his series". On the issue of the initial creation, Ditko states, "I still don't know whose idea was Spider-Man".
			Kirby noted in a 1971 interview that it was Ditko who "got Spider-Man to roll, and the thing caught on because of what 
			he did".Lee, while claiming credit for the initial idea, has acknowledged Ditko's role, stating, "If Steve wants 
			to be called co-creator, I think he deserves [it]".He has further commented that Ditko's costume design was key to 
			the character's success; since the costume completely covers Spider-Man's body, people of all races could visualize 
			themselves inside the costume and thus more easily identify with the character.Writer Al Nickerson believes "that 
			Stan Lee and Steve Ditko created the Spider-Man that we are familiar with today [but that] ultimately, Spider-Man came 
			into existence, and prospered, through the efforts of not just one or two, but many, comic book creators".</p>

				 </div>
			<p>A bite from a radioactive spider triggers mutations in Peter Parker's body, granting him superpowers.In the original 
			Lee-Ditko stories, Spider-Man has the ability to cling to walls, superhuman strength, a sixth sense ("spider-sense") 
			that alerts him to danger, perfect balance and equilibrium, as well as superhuman speed and agility.The character 
			was originally conceived by Stan Lee and Steve Ditko as intellectually gifted, but later writers have depicted his 
			intellect at genius level.Academically brilliant, Parker has expertise in the fields of applied science, chemistry, 
			physics, biology, engineering, mathematics, and mechanics. With his talents, he sews his own costume to conceal his 
			identity, and he constructs many devices that complement his powers, most notably mechanical web-shooters.This mechanism 
			ejects an advanced adhesive, releasing web-fluid in a variety of configurations, including a single rope-like strand to 
			swing from, a net to snare or bind enemies, and a simple glob to foul machinery or blind an opponent. He can also weave 
			the web material into simple forms like a shield, a spherical protection or hemispherical barrier, a club, or a hang-glider 
			wing. Other equipment include spider-tracers (spider-shaped adhesive homing beacons keyed to his own spider-sense), a 
			light beacon which can either be used as a flashlight or project a "Spider-Signal" design, and a specially modified camera 
			that can take pictures automatically.</p>

                 <h2>Other versions</h2>
				 </div>
		    <p>Due to Spider-Man's popularity in the mainstream Marvel Universe, publishers have been able to introduce different 
			variations of Spider-Man outside of mainstream comics as well as reimagined stories in many other multiversed spinoffs 
			such as Ultimate Spider-Man, Spider-Man 2099, and Spider-Man: India. Marvel has also made its own parodies of Spider-Man 
			in comics such as Not Brand Echh, which was published in the late 1960s and featured such characters as Peter Pooper 
			alias Spidey-Man, and Peter Porker, the Spectacular Spider-Ham, who appeared in the 1980s. The fictional character 
			has also inspired a number of deratives such as a manga version of Spider-Man drawn by Japanese artist Ryoichi Ikegami 
			as well as Hideshi Hino's The Bug Boy, which has been cited as inspired by Spider-Man.Also the French comic 
			Télé-Junior published strips based on popular TV series. In the late 1970s, the publisher also produced original 
			Spider-Man adventures. Artists included Gérald Forton, who later moved to America and worked for Marvel.</p>
