		<object width="960" height="540" data="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kedu3murYBg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></object>
		<p>This version of Spider-Man appeared in a 4 issue miniseries (Feb-May 2009). He exists in the Great Depression Era of 
		New York in the 1930s. Aunt May is a speaker of equality and spends time standing on a soap box shouting her beliefs. 
		Uncle Ben was killed by a crime syndicate run by Norman Osborn, aka The Goblin. Shortly afterward, Peter is bitten by a 
		strange spider and endowed with mystical spider-powers. Though he has no wall-crawling ability, he has increased agility, 
		strength, a form of spider-sense, and can spray nets of webbing from his hand. He then dons a black mask, gloves, and a 
		trenchcoat and sets out to stop Norman and his gang. This version of Spider-Man appears in the game.</p>
		
		<div id="head"> <h1>Spyder Knight</h1></div>
		<object width="960" height="540" data="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9D1QYEv1raI" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></object>
		<p>This is Christopher Daniel Barnes' third role as an alternate universe's Spider-Man the, other being Spider-Man Noir in Shattered Dimensions, and Spider-Man 2099 in Edge of Time.
		<br />
		He's the only Spider-Man from an alternate universe that has no personal issues of his own that the original Spider-Man have to fix, as the others have their own problems such as Spider-Man 2099's problems trying to restore the Spider-Man's legacy, Spider-Man Noir keeps being away from public, Spider-Girl's dislike of males trying to be superheroes, Spider-Ham's loss of confidence, and Ultimate Spider-Man's trauma of Peter's death.

		<object width="960" height="540" data="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1N6ZWN7rPCU" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></object>
		<p>After battling the Living Laser and being saved by Iron Man, Spider-Man was offered by Tony Stark to visit Stark Industries Main Plant and gave him his own armor, called the Iron Spider Armor. His inexperience led to minor disasters each mission he used it, angering his fellow teammates. When Living Laser possessed his suit, Spider-Man was forced to battle Iron Man, making Laser to possess Stark's suit after. With a improved version of the Iron Spider suit, Spider-Man was aided by the trainees to fight Iron Man/Living Laser. Spider-Man managed to wake up Stark so he could remove Laser from the armor, the villain was ultimately defeated when Spider-Man used in him a machine which teleported him to an alternate universe.

		<div id="head"> <h1>Spider-Man 2099</h1></div>
		<object width="960" height="540" data="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YCWONOtGAwk" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></object>
		<p>A geneticist named Miguel O'Hara gained his spider-like powers from a gene-splicing incident, when the company he was about to quit injected him with a dangerous drug called Rapture. He tried to rid himself of the drug by using the Gene Slicer he helped to invent, but unbeknownst to him a jealous co-worker had set it to repeat the previous experiment of a spider. The last time they had tried this experiment it killed the test subject (the main reason Miguel O'Hara quit), but this time it worked. Instead of becoming a company owned version of Spider-Man he became the opposite, a Spider-Man to fight Alchemax and the other large corporations ruling the world in 2099. He now fights crime as the Spider-Man of 2099.
		<br />
		
        He is a playable character in the video games Spider-Man Shattered Dimensions and Spider-Man: Edge of Time, with Edge of Time seeing him pitted against a psychotic version of Peter Parker in 2099, this Peter having become the CEO of Alchemax and attempting to rewrite the universe to fit his vision. CEO Peter uses an elaborate spider-based robot in his fight against Miguel, but Miguel is able to defeat him by using the tentacles of Atrocity- a twisted hybrid of Anti-Venom, Doctor Octopus, and Alchemax employee Walker Sloan- to weaken CEO Peter's powers.</p>

		<div id="head"> <h1>Spider-Girl</h1></div>
		<object width="960" height="540" data="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sYxCvQt100U" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></object>
		
		<p>The Spider-Girl comic book series, originally published under the MC2 imprint, features May "Mayday" Parker, Peter's 
		daughter in an alternative continuity. This timeline diverged from regular continuity when Peter and Mary Jane's daughter 
		is returned to them by Kaine. In Spider-Girl, Peter has been retired from crime fighting since his final battle with the 
		Green Goblin, which cost him a leg. Peter has settled down to family life and works for the New York City Police Department 
		as a forensic scientist. His teen daughter May follows in his footsteps against his wishes, but Peter eventually helps her 
		train for her calling. Peter appears in costume several times in Spider-Girl, either to restrain and protect May, or to 
		assist her. Peter is among the superheroes kidnapped by Loki in the spin-off Last Hero Standing.
         <br />
          In the recent Spider-Girl storyline "Brand New May", Peter has uncovered a lab, within it is a stasis tank containing
		   an exact physical duplicate of Mayday Parker, with notes left behind by Norman Osborn suggesting she is the real Mayday,
		    and not a clone. When protecting his nephew Normie from an exploding test tube, Peter is affected by the serum within 
			much like Osborn was...and begins to develop erratic behavior. He ultimately overcomes an attempt by Norman Osborn to 
			control his mind and defeats him with the aid of his daughter, her clone, and the spirit of his Aunt May.</p>

		<div id="head"> <h1>Some of the Other Versions </h1>   </div>
		
		
		
        <p>Spider-Man (also described as Spider-Men and Spider-Totem) is the name of multiple comic book characters from the 
		Marvel Comics Multiverse. The original and most well known is Peter Parker created by Stan Lee and Steve Ditko originating 
		from the Earth 616 universe. Within the mainstream Marvel Universe there have been other characters that have taken the 
		mantle such as Ben Reilly and Doctor Octavius.</p>
		   
        <p>
         Outside of the mainstream universe there are different incarnations of Spider-Man in alternate universes such as the 
		 Ultimate universe version and the Marvel 2099 version. Originally these characters were depicted as separate from each 
		 other but later on they have crossed over together such as Peter Parker and Miles Morales teaming up in Spider-Men and 
		 in "Spider-Verse" where the many versions of Spider-Men are the major protagonist of the storyline. These characters were 
		 later merged in the same universe in the 2015 comic book series Secret Wars as a part of the Spider-Man family.</p>

		<div id="head"> <h1>Marvel Adventures</h1></div>
		<p>This version of Spider-Man first appeared in Marvel Adventures Spider-Man #53-#61 before appearing in the re-titled 
		Spider-Man: Marvel Adventures comic book series. A modern-day high school student, this Spider-Man's origin is similar 
		to his mainstream counterpart, but his supporting cast is significantly different. Although Gwen Stacy exists in this 
		universe, she and Peter are not dating—instead Peter is dating a brand-new character named Sophia "Chat" Sanduval, who 
		is a mutant with the ability to talk to animals. Peter's relationship with Gwen's father Captain George Stacy also differs 
		from the original version—here, Captain Stacy discovers Peter's secret identity early on, yet rather than hide this 
		information from Peter (as his mainstream counterpart did), he confides in Peter and becomes Spider-Man's unofficial police 
		contact. While this Spider-Man battles super villains, he is generally more concerned with combating street-level crime and 
		focuses heavily on taking down the Torino Family, a powerful New York City mob.</p>

		<div id="head"> <h1>MC2</h1></div>
		<p>An alternative version of Peter Parker also exists in the Marvel Comics 2 (MC2) universe, appearing as a supporting 
		character in Spider-Girl.
        <br />
         The title follows almost the entire original timeline of the character up until the first attempt at a "relaunch" by the company, 
         1999, where it deviates and provides an alternative ending to the Final Chapter storyline. Peter's wayward daughter May is revealed 
         to be alive and well, and is returned to both Parkers by Peter's first clone, the redeemed Kaine. Despite now being a father, Peter 
         continues to fight crime as Spider-Man, and begins to cope with the new responsibilities brought by his baby daughter.
         <br />
           Two years later, during his final battle against the Green Goblin, rather than survive unscathed, Peter loses a leg to his 
         arch-enemy and Osborn is killed.Peter finally realizes the price he has paid for being Spider-Man, 
         and ends his career to raise a family with Mary Jane and May. Over the years, he overcomes his physical handicap and 
		 ultimately joins the NYPD in a scientific capacity. However, after saving him from an insane Normie Osborn, his 
		 daughter May "Mayday" Parker begins a career as Spider-Girl behind his back, a decision Peter begrudgingly is forced to 
		 accept and deal with, made difficult by his love for May.
         <br />
          Regardless of his handicap, Peter returned to the role of Spider-Man several times. Once was to aid his daughter and 
		  Darkdevil, the son of Ben Reilly, against Kaine, another to convince the latest Spider-Man (the son of Jessica Drew), 
		  to cease risking his life, and in the 100th issue of the Spider-Girl title to save May from the Hobgoblin. Peter and MJ 
		  ultimately have a second child, Benjamin "Benjy" Parker Jr, who is temporarily rendered deaf after possession by the 
		  Carnage symbiote and being blasted with high-frequency sonics. Benjy later develops powers of his own at an infant age.</p>

		<div id="head"> <h1>Spider-Man (Gerry Drew)</h1></div>
		<p>In the same MC2 continuity as Spider-Girl, Gerald "Gerry" Drew, the son of Jessica Drew, inherits spider-powers and
		 poses as Spider-Man. Created by Tom DeFalco and Ron Frenz, he first appeared in Spider-Girl #32 (May 2001), and is a 
		 supporting character of Spider-Girl.
        		   <br />
        Within the context of the stories, Jessica Drew, the original Spider-Woman, had retired from super heroics, and 
		gotten married. She gives birth to a baby boy, Gerry, who was diagnosed with a strange blood-borne disorder due 
		to radiation exposure in the womb. With doctors and medicines unable to help her son, Jessica recreates the experiment 
		that cured her of her radiation poisoning, the experiment that made her Spider-Woman. The experiment imbues Gerry with 
		spider-like powers, but did not cure him. Gerry's illness strains his parents' marriage and leads to their divorce. 
		Feeling responsible for the break-up, Gerry becomes withdrawn. Jessica tries to alleviate his pain by telling him stories 
		from her past, his favorites involving Spider-Man.
		   <br />
        Determined to make his short time on Earth count, Gerry designs his own Spider-Man costume and equipment based from 
		his idol's, and convinces his mother to train him in how to use his powers. Calling himself Spider-Man, he meets 
		Spider-Girl, and the two initially clash.[26] During a fight between several villains, a bullet intended for Spider-Man 
		kills one of the villains when Spider-Girl shoves him out of its way. Upset that he was responsible for a death, Gerry 
		runs into Darkdevil, who trains him to be a more effective crime fighter. At the request of Peter Parker, the original 
		Spider-Man, Gerry decides to retire from super heroic adventuring while Reed Richards searches for a cure for his blood 
		disease.</p>

		<div id="head"> <h1>Marvel Zombies version</h1></div>
		<p>Often within the Marvel Zombies universe, it features a zombified Spider-Man who has been turned, along with all 
		other heroes in the Marvel Universe, into a flesh-eating zombie. He is actually infected by Zombie Captain America 
		(actually known as "Colonel America") rather namely in the first issue of Marvel Zombies vs. The Army of Darkness, 
		when the infected ex-president bites him on the shoulder, leaving a wound.[28] Although Spider-Man is just as ravenous, 
		cannabalistic and disgusting as the other zombies when hungry, when he has eaten, Spider-Man is constantly racked with 
		guilt at what he has done, agonizing over having eaten Mary Jane and Aunt May, but unable to change his nature. At the 
		conclusion of the storyline, Spider-Man is one of the few heroes who become The Galactus, having consumed the original
		 Galactus and subsequently acquiring his cosmic powers. Later, the Marvel Zombies attack a Skrull planet, only to
		  encounter the new Fantastic Four of the core "616" reality — then consisting of Black Panther, Storm, the Thing and 
		  the Human Torch- leaving the Zombies eager to capture the FF and transport back to their reality, although the FF manage
		   to escape.
<br />
       In Marvel Zombies 2, he is seen with a new cyborg lower leg as well as having his mask repaired as he is seen with it 
	   covering his face once again. He has noticed that his hunger is starting to fade, and, as a result, is the first 
	   of the Galactus to turn against his fellow zombies, plus Luke Cage joining him as the two confront Wolverine, Hulk, Iron Man, 
	   and the other infected.Eventually with the aid of Forge, Malcom, and the Acolytes, the zombies retaining their hunger are 
	   defeated, and many of them are violently killed by an infected Hulk, in the process. Spider-Man is one of the zombies that 
	   remain after having killed the Hulk with his cosmic powers, and continue to rebuild New Wakanda, and bury the dead.
<br />
        Having mastered his hunger, Spider-Man is teleported to a new world, where he consumes and infects the Sinister Six 
		except for Sandman who ran away, however, as his cosmic abilities did not come with him, and his webshooters have 
		somehow dried up, the zombified superhero is forced to make do with his own veins and arteries, a process which he finds
		 to be quite painful, though it is commonly known that these Zombies do not feel pain at all. Following the death of the
		  Spider-Man of this universe- killed by Sandman in revenge for the deaths of the Sinister Six after zombie Spider-Man 
		  reverted to type and tore the rest of the Six apart after they killed his other self's family-[34] the zombie Spider-Man 
		  works on developing a cure for the plague with the aid of the Kitty Pryde of this universe- on the grounds that her powers
		   mean that she would be at no risk from him if he loses control- using nanites and the blood of this world's Wolverine.
		    With the zombie Giant-Man having followed Spider-Man to this new reality — having already infected the Inhumans 
			(comics), the Hulk, and the Sentry, Spider-Man resolves to stop Giant-Man.
<br />
         Spider-Man managed to get the Earth-Z infected Wolverine, the Hulk, & the half cybernectic Rhodey- the last now living 
		 Iron Man with cybernetic limbs, having cut off his infected body parts to escape being turned into a zombie- and dubbed
		  themselves as the New Avengers as they confront Giant-Man with the infected Quicksilver, Thundra, Sentry, Moon Knight, 
		  Super Skrull, Quasar and others to which they are responsible for killing Loki, Hawkeye, Captain America, Thor, and
		   other deceased characters listed and shown. Determined to end the zombie plague forever, Spider-Man ordered the team 
		   to destroy the canister he was carrying, which released the Sandman, now infused with nanobites, and wiped out every 
		   zombie hero and villain. (Giant-Man was destroyed by Sandman) And afterwards, the Zombie Spider-Man thanked Sandman
		    and commented that his Aunt May and Mary Jane were avenged. He died from being exposed to his own weapon, which happened 
			to be Sandman.</p>

		occurs when he and his clone continue to coexist after the end of the original Clone Saga. The two keep this a secret by taking 
		care to never appear in public at the same time, but "Man-Spider" is forced to admit the truth after his clone is killed by

Jonah Jameson, whilst battling crime in his disguise as Spider-Man. In addition to opposing classic enemies, much of the strip sees Peter battle new enemies. He has also teamed up with various heroes through the strip's run, such as Daredevil and Wolverine. He is married to Mary Jane in this continuity, and has often been aided by her in his battles with his enemies. This universe was visited by Morlun during the Spider-Verse event, but due to time distortions constantly resetting things so that the simplest actions take weeks to progress, Morlun finds his efforts to consume this version of Peter fruitless. The Master Weaver of the Inheritors elects to rebel against his masters for once and seals this universe away in a pocket dimension where it will remain safe from any further attacks.</p>

		<p>Warren Ellis's parody of Kurt Busiek's Marvels, Ruins, was a two-part miniseries set in an alternative universe where the situations that led to the heroes of the Marvel Universe gaining superpowers instead led to the more realistic side effects of horrific deformities and deaths. In this world, when Parker was bitten by a radioactive spider, instead of gaining powers, he broke out into an infectious rash that covered his body before his painful death. He had visited the offices of the Daily Bugle beforehand and infected fellow photographer Phil Sheldon, who set off to figure out how his world took a wrong turn, but succumbed to the disease before he could write his book.</p>

		<div id="head"> <h1>Spectacular Spider-Man Adventures</h1></div>
		<p>The United Kingdom based Panini Comics publication Spectacular Spider-Man Adventures was loosely based on the continuity of the 1990s animated series. In the series Peter Parker deals with the day-to-day headaches of balancing a social life with his super-heroics. He has a close circle of friends such as Liz Allen, Harry Osborn, and Flash Thompson, and he is involved in a relationship with Mary Jane. However, in this continuity, Mary Jane does not possess an existing knowledge of his dual identity, and thus Peter finds juggling his life with her and his crime-fighting career difficult. Despite this, Mary Jane loyally supports Peter, believing it is his dangerous job as a photographer that keeps him away from dates and other activities. A look into the future reveals Peter and MJ ultimately get married in this continuity, and have a daughter, May, who is active as Spider-Girl. At some point in this future, Peter loses his leg, which forces him to retire as Spider-Man.</p>
