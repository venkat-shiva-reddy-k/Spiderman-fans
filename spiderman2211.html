History
Dr. Max Borne, a TimeSpinner from the year 2211, is the Spider-Man of that year. His costume is different from the costume of the original Spider-Man, in that it has four extra mechanized arms, but it does follow the same color scheme of red and blue. He is part of an organization that tries to prevent disruptions in the time field.</p>
<p>He lated aided Spider-Man and Spider-Man 2099 in defeating the Hobgoblin of 2211, his main enemy. It was later discovered that the Hobgoblin was in fact Robin Borne, his daughter. After Robin attempted to bring chaos into the current reality by introducing another Uncle Ben into it, she was unwittingly erased by Spider-Man with one of her own retcon bombs</p>
<p>Spider-Man 2211 was later shot and apparently killed by the Chameleon of the year 2211, posing as Uncle Ben</p>
<p>Later Max was recruited by Spider-UK to his Spider-Army.</p>		   
<p>Borne possesses superhuman strength (able to lift 25 tons optimally), agility and endurance.</p>
