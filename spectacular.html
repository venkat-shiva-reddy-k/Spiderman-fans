         <p>Spectacular Spider-Man Adventures was a title published by Panini Comics in the United Kingdom from November 1995 to September 2005, although the Adventures portion of the title was often dropped from the cover page. It featured a mix of reprinted American material as well as originally produced British material. Spectacular was aimed at a younger audience than Panini's other Spider-Man reprint title Astonishing Spider-Man, and was loosely based on the continuity of the 1990s animated series.</p
		 <p>Published by the UK wing of Panini Comics. Initially the series reprinted US Spider-Man Adventures stories, set in the Spider-Man: The Animated Series cartoon universe. When available reprints ran out, the series switched to using brand new stories written and drawn by British creative teams, and shortly afterwards, with issue 70, the series dropped the word Adventures from its title. In late 2011, following new instructions from Marvel's US offices that original Marvel material was no longer to be produced outside the US, Spectacular Spider-Man switched to reprinting Spider-Man stories from the American Marvel Adventures imprint. This prompted a name change to Spider-Man Magazine, before changing again to Ultimate Spider-Man when it started printing material from the Ultimate Spider-Man TV tie-in comic.</p>
         <p>The Spectacular Spider-Man is the name of several comic books and one magazine series starring Marvel Comics' Spider-Man.

Following the success of Spider-Man's original series, The Amazing Spider-Man, Marvel felt the character could support more than one title. This led the company in 1968 to launch a short-lived magazine, the first to bear the Spectacular name. In 1972, Marvel more successfully launched a second Spider-Man ongoing series, Marvel Team-Up, in which he was paired with other Marvel heroes. A third monthly ongoing series, Peter Parker, The Spectacular Spider-Man, debuted in 1976.</p>
