		      <p>Spider-Man: House of M is a five-issue comic book limited series that ran concurrently with Marvel Comics' House of M crossover event in 2005. In the House of M pocket universe, mutants rule the world and humans are an oppressed minority. Magneto and his family, the House of M, rule the world from the island of Genosha.</p>
			  <p>Much like the Fantastic Four: House of M miniseries, Spider-Man: House of M is a standalone story that takes place in the House of M universe, but the events do not affect the story of the actual House of M series. However, it is shown in the House of M series that the Peter Parker of the mainstream Marvel Universe remembers the life he had in this pocket universe.</p>
			  <p>An issue of What If...? had two alternative stories that could have happened from the Spider-Man: House of M story, including Gwen Stacy accompanying the heroes in the final assault and Gwen and Richard Parker being restored to the real world after Wanda cast her final spell.</p>
			  <p>When the 'Superior Spider-Man'- Doctor Octopus in Spider-Man's body- found himself temporarily trapped in the year 2099, his attempts to return home via a dimensional portal resulted in him witnessing various alternate worlds where other Spider-Men had been killed by a dimension-hopping adversary, including a dead Spider-Man in what appeared to be the world of the House of M.</p>
			  <p>A HOUSE OF M SPECIAL EVENT! Meet Spider-Man--hero to the people, champion of the weak and oppressed... and World Wrestling Alliance Championship Titleholder?</p>
			  <p>Peter Parker has it all --respect, fame, and the adoration of all. But he also has a deep, destructive secret that he keeps from the world and from his family--one that could well unravel the reality he knows!</p>
