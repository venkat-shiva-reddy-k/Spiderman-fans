		       <p> Peter Parker is no longer a superhero and during the course of the series becomes a police officer. Three other related characters appear.<br/>
			   The Spiders Man is an enigmatic character who makes illusions using webs that come from his sleeves. He has lumpy red skin that resembles Spider-Man's costume, and wears a tattered cloak<br/>
			   Two alternative versions of Spider-Girl appear: one is called Venom and the other was raised by Ben Reilly<br />
			   </p>
			   <p>Peter Parker was publicly revealed as Spider-Man and retired, figuring he was no longer needed in this world of powers. However, he leaps into action once again after his daughter had been turned into a slave of the Skull.
			   </p>
			   <p>Earth X began in 1997 when, in the wake of DC Comics' Kingdom Come miniseries (created by Alex Ross and Mark Waid), Wizard Magazine asked Ross to imagine a possible dystopian future for Marvel. Ross sketched out some ideas of what some of the most well-known Marvel characters (including Spider-Man, Captain America and the Incredible Hulk) might be like in a future where all ordinary humans had gained superpowers, and what would become of the heroes who had once been set apart by abilities which were now commonplace. The issue of Wizard, which contained the Ross article (accompanied by his characteristic illustrations), sold out rapidly. Demand was so extensive that in 1999 (in affiliation with Marvel), they republished the article as a separate booklet, the Earth X Sketchbook, which likewise sold out. Taking this as a clear indicator of fan interest, Marvel commissioned Ross to create a full series based on his notes.
			   </p>
			   <p>Initially, the Earth X storyline was purported as being the future of Earth-616. However, the series often substantially retconned the origins and workings of characters to better suit the story, to the point where they were no longer reconcilable with their counterparts in the mainstream Marvel Universe
			   </p>
			   <p>
			   A one-shot called The Earth X Companion was released in 2008, containing production notes and sketches by Jim Krueger and Alex Ross as well as a short story drawn by artist Bill Reinhold detailing the fate of one of Nick Fury's Life Model Decoys
